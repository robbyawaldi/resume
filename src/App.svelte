            Neural Technologies Indonesia (2021 - Present)
          </h2>
          <p>
            I worked at Neural Technologies Indonesia as a team leader for
            several years. During my time there, I was responsible for
            overseeing various projects related to the development of
            dashboards, ERP platforms, and business intelligence systems. In
            addition, I developed a reusable library that was utilized for
            internal purposes, which helped to streamline our development
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my primary responsibilities as a team leader was to ensure
            that each project was completed efficiently and effectively. To
            accomplish this, I worked closely with my team to design processes
            such as flow, CI/CD, and other development practices. I also led the
            effort to implement these processes throughout the organization,
            ensuring that they were followed consistently by all team members.
